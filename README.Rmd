`wbids` is an R package that provides a modern, flexible interface for accessing the World Bank’s [International Debt Statistics (IDS)](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0038015). `wbids` allows users to download, process, and analyze IDS series for multiple geographies, counterparts and specific time periods. The package is designed to work seamlessly with World Development Indicators (WDI) provided through the `wbwdi` package. 

The `wbids` package relies on a redefinition of the original World Bank data: 'geographies' contain both countries and regions, while 'counterparts' include both counterpart areas and institutions. `wbids` provides a consistent mapping of identifiers and names across these different types. See the package vignette for more details on the data model: TODO: INSERT LINK TO VIGNETTE LATER

This package is a product of Teal Insights and not sponsored by or affiliated with the World Bank in any way, except for the use of the World Bank IDS API.

## Installation 

You can install the development version of `wbids` like this:

```r
pak::pak("teal-insights/r-wbids")
```

## Usage

The main function `ids_get()` provides an interface to download multiple IDS series for multiple geographies and counterparts and specific date ranges. 

```r
library(wbids)

ids_get(
  geographies = c("ZMB", "ZAF"),
  series = c("DT.DOD.DPPG.CD", "BM.GSR.TOTL.CD"),
  counterparts = c("216", "231"),
  start_date = 2015,
  end_date = 2020
)
```

The package comes with prepared metadata about available series, geographies, counterparts, and topics:

```r
ids_list_series()
ids_list_georaphies()
ids_list_counterparts()
ids_list_series_topics()
```

This data can be used to enrich the IDS data or facilitate data discovery. For further applications, please consult [Teal Insights’ Guide to Working with the World Bank International Debt Statistics](https://teal-insights.github.io/teal_insights_guide_to_wbids/).

The interface and namings are fully consistent with World Development Indicators (WDI) data provided through the 'wbwdi' package. You can find details on [github.com/tidy-intelligence/r-wbwdi](https://github.com/tidy-intelligence/r-wbwdi).
